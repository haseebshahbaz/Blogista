# Blogista

## Project Overview
**Blogista** is a full-stack blogging platform built as part of my web development journey. The application provides users with the ability to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. It integrates **Firebase** for user authentication and Firestore as the database for storing blog content. The user interface is built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, offering a clean and responsive design.

## Features
- User authentication with Firebase (sign up, login, and logout).
- Real-time blog data management with Firestore.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for blog posts.
- A responsive, user-friendly design.
- Smooth navigation between pages.

## Technologies Used
- **Next**: For building the user interface.
- **Firebase**: For backend services (Authentication and Firestore).
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern styling.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive functionality and app logic.
